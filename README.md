Nowadays, almost every person has a smartphone, and they are as easily accessible as they are widely used. Computers, in whatever form, allow users to perform
daily tasks and duties faster, easier, and more efficiently, as well as to search for and
save information. Smartphones add the advantage of portability to the computer,
allowing it to be used almost anywhere.
Some of the most popular games are role-playing games (RPGs). These games are
divided into further subcategories, including tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG).

Among TTRPGs, one of the most popular games is Dungeon & Dragons.
D&D is a TTRPG game system, under constant development. It helps players
to create their own world. There are countless items in the game world, and even
when something does not exist, with the permission of the organizing player it can
be added to the game. This results in situations where players keep getting new
items and getting rid of old ones. Traditionally, the character and its inventory are
written on a piece of paper, this means constantly replacing pieces of paper with
new ones or repetitively erasing and writing down any changes when they occur.

This paper presents the idea, design, and implementation of an application based
on an Android system. The goal of the app is to make it easier for the D&D players
to manage the characters and their inventory as well as to easily access this data
through Googleâ€™s Firebase.
